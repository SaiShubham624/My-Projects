Inheritance is a type of OOPs in which a class is inherited 
from other classes

There are Four Types of Inheritance:-
1. Single Inheritance - A single class id derived from single class
2. Multiple Inheritance - A derived class with more than one base class
3. Herichal Inheritance - Several derived classes from a single class
4. Multilevel Inheritance - deriving a class from already derived class
5. Hybrid Inheritance - is a combination of Multiple Inheritance and 
Multilevel Inheritance and Herichal Inheritance
